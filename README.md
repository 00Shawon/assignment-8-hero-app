# React + Vite
This app name is Assignment-8 because it is made for PH's assignment. It is Basically an appStore where you can find your fabourite app. This app is an example of practical react routing.  
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.Also usded some of the react libraries such as 
1. Lucid React,
2. Toastify ,
3. axiox ,
4. react router.
This app combined tailwind CSS , Daisy ui with react to design the app in minimal effort. Finally, deployed in netlify.  

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
